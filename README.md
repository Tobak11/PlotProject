# PlotProject

In this project I was creating data visualization API using JavaFX.

StaticPlots: it a demo project created to test, how can you use JavaFX for data visualization. The graphs are non-resizeable, not really well polished, but good for demonstration purposes. It features 7 different charts: Linechart, Histogram, Areachart, Markerchart, BoundedLinechart, Boxchart, BoundedLinechart(MultiPlot)

FinalChartStructure: features only Linechart, but it's an easily, well usable API. The code is finely structured using Data-View model. Its performance is close to the optimal (using deep bindings), it's resizeable and deeply customizable.

Both projects were made in Netbeans 8.0.2, using JDK 1.8.
